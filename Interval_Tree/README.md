# Tutorial 3

Interval Trees: Implement interval trees. (Implement from scratch). Submit git hub link. No restriction on programming language.

Minimum Methods:
1. insert (node, interval)
2. delete (item)
3. search (node, interval)

Sample Data set:

```
{15, 20}, {10, 30}, {17, 19},{5, 20}, {12, 15}, {30, 40}
Check for {14,16}, {21,23}.
```

Note: Work on your own on this. There are many online resources to help you on this, but avoid them. Read the book and slides.  

For students with no knowledge of git hub, some resources

1. https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git
2. There are thousands of videos on youtube to learn about github.

# Warning

```
DO NOT USE THE DELETE FUNCTION AS OF NOW
```

The delete function is incomplete and messes up the tree. Trying to fix the bug. Since time to submission is near, an incomplete one may be submitted.
